## Summary

My research interests span Bioinformation analysis, Transfer Learning, Computer Vision, Few-shot Learning, and Domain Adaptation. I have two papers accepted in AAAI, one paper accepted in ACM MM(CCFA), and seven papers published in SCI journals, of which two are in JCR-Q1 and one in CCFC. Additionally, I have submitted one to ICDE(CCFA), one to Knowledge-Based Systems(CCFC), and one to Information Sciences(CCFB). I will submit two papers to IJCAI(CCFA).
