<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Houcheng Su, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Data Science and Analytics at **Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)** under the supervision of [Yanlin Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=1K76SCUAAAAJ). Previously, I completed my Master’s degree in Data Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence Applications at the **University of Macau** , where [Chi-Man Vong](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=uFUPIekAAAAJ) advised me. I also hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Technology from **Sichuan Agricultural University** .

My research interests encompass Bioinformation Analysis, Transfer Learning, Computer Vision, and Domain Adaptation. 

If you want to cooperate on related research topics with me, you can contact me by email at any time.
