<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am Houcheng Su, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Data Science and Analytics at HKUST (GZ) under the supervision of Yanlin Zhang. My research interests encompass Bioinformation Analysis, Transfer Learning, Computer Vision, Few-shot Learning, and Domain Adaptation. Previously, I completed my Master’s degree in Data Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence Applications at the University of Macau, where I was advised by Chi-Man Vong. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Sichuan Agricultural University.
